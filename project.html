 <container class="bcontainer">
    <h3> The main aim of this project is to observe patterns in government quality emerging from countries under the same colonial powers. 
      This project is motivated by the paper <i>The Quality of Government</i> by La Porta et al. (1999), that concluded that legal origins of is a major 
    factor government quality. The research question is explored through different measures of government quality based on former colonies of the British, 
    Spanish and Russian empires. The visualisations used in this project are scatter plots, bar and line charts with sliders and drop-down lists to condense 
    the dataset into a single chart. The value of each observation can be found by hovering over the charts </h3>

 <h2><span>Data</span></h2> 
 <container class="bcontainer">
   <h3> The data for this project is mainly from the World Bank downloaded using Python in  
     <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/athirahridzal/athirahridzal.github.io/blob/main/Colab_DownloadWB_Project.ipynb" target="_blank"> Colab</a> using the API. 
     Datasets from other sources are downloaded directly from <a class="textLink" href="https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"> TCdata360</a> and 
     some datasets are cleaned and merged using Stata. The selected sample for the former colonies for the Russian empire were countries under the Soviet Union state, 
     whereas for the <a class="textLink" href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/former-british-colonies.html" target="_blank"> British</a> and 
     <a class="textLink" href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/former-spanish-colonies.html" target="_blank"> Spanish</a> are a random selection of countries 
     that were previously colonised by the respective empires. Colonisation by different empires can occurred simultaneously in different areas of a country, therefore 
     the selected sample of countries are defined by the colonisation of the whole land.  </h3>

       higher outputs in public goods.

<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2> 
<container class="bcontainer">
  <h3> Minor patterns emerged for each colonial empire, more so under the Russian empire. The apparent effect on former colonies under the Russian empire is likely since the 
    countries gained independence most recently in 1991. Moreover, the Soviet Union operated as a single country rather than the common definition of colonialism of foreign 
    political control. Surprisingly, countries under the British empire show the least similarities, showing high variation across variables. Therefore, colonial empires impact 
    the government quality of the colonies in varying ways – relatively higher inequality, freer press or higher outcomes of public goods. Nonetheless, every country has different 
    resources, experienced varying degrees of economic crisis and have accumulated centuries of history and culture. These visualisations are only able to describe one factor that 
    affects the variation in government quality over the years.  </h3>
